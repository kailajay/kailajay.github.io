          <div class="about-content">
            <p>UCD came into being in the summer of 2018, after Kaii (that's me, hi!)
            finished an Art and Design Course. I've been sewing since I was a child, and
          I love making all sorts of things now. I have well over a decade of experience in
          sewing and crafting, and six years of LARP specific experience. I take your
          ideas from <em>concept to character</em> and will work with you every step
          of the way to make a really fantastic costume that works for you and your character.</p>
         <p><h3>What Do We Offer?</h3></p>
         <p> We can work with you to make anything, from a single item of costume; tunics to ballgowns.
           We can help you source or make specific and important props, and we can help you source the best
           weapons for you and your character. We're happy to help with design ideas, embroidery files and
           designs, and even screen printing and templates for spray painting. Our biggest feature, however,
           is helping you go from your basic concept all the way through to a fully fleshed out, outfitted character
           with props, weapons and makeup.
         </p>
         <p><h3>Kaii's Creations & Accessories</h3></p>
         <p>Kaii's Creations was started back in 2012 when I first really got into sewing not just for pleasure.
           I've kept it up ever since, and offer various accessories, both for LARP and every day use, along with
           modern, plus size clothing. I also take commissions for these. </p>
           <p><h3>What Next?</h3></p>
            <p> I have a blog on this website, accessible through the link at the top of the page. You should also check
              out my Projects page, which shows some of my favourite projects I've worked on. I also have a Facebook
              linked at the bottom of the page, with my personal Twitter and the Kaii's Creations Etsy Page. If you want to
              get in contact with me, please message the facebook page, email me via the Contact button at the top of the page,
